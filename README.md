# Orijin: A Decentralized Web3 Game Marketplace

Orijin is a blockchain-based Digital Rights Management (DRM) system designed to solve the challenges of traditional software licensing models. This solution gives software developers verifiable ownership and control by leveraging tokenization and smart contract deployment. Each game is minted as a unique NFT with a private ID to prevent piracy. 

By creating a decentralized Web3 marketplace, Orijin allows games to be bought, sold, and resold securely. A game buyer can resell their game by transferring ownership of the game NFT to a new buyer, while the original developer earns a royalty fee. The reseller loses ownership of the game NFT after the sale, ensuring fair trade practices. Additionally, every time a game developer mints a new game NFT copy, a small transaction fee is incurred.
